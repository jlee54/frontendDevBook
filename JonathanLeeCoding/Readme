Projects I'm working on from a Front End book. Currently the ottergram is complete (according to the book standards) and the coffeerun is in progress. If you run the Ottergram you'll notice it is not
using otters but in fact a poor picture of my mom's face. I wrote most of this without Wifi, so I could not obtain beautiful pictures of Otters.
